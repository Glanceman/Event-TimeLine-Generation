When he became president in 2021, he framed global politics as a  struggle between democracies and autocracies. The key thrust of that message was to find like-minded partners – deemed “democratic” by Washington – to counter America’s major geopolitical rivals, namely China and Russia.Biden also used this rhetoric on democratic values as a response to his predecessor, Donald Trump. As president, Trump had largely dispensed with values-based rhetoric in foreign policy, leading an era of “ America first” isolationism, and praising autocratic leaders from Hungary’s Viktor Orban to Russia’s Vladimir Putin.Biden called on the US to return to a role of moral leadership – to “ prove democracy works” – and strengthen democracy at home and abroad. This, he proposed, would distinguish the US from its rivals. To that end, Biden organised two Summits for Democracy and rallied countries around democratic norms and values.

He also echoed President Joe Biden’s calls for a brief halt in the fighting to address a worsening humanitarian crisis.Alarm has grown over spiralling Palestinian deaths and deepening misery for civilians from weeks of Israeli bombardment and a widening ground assault that risks even greater casualties. Overwhelmed hospitals say they are nearing collapse, with medicine and fuel running low under the Israeli siege.

It feels like a balance has been lost between the West and rest.What is the West? It is a world that essentially comprises the US-led North America, Europe and Australasia, including Japan. It accounts for 63 per cent of the world economy, three-quarters of world trade, over half of global energy consumption and 18 per cent of the world population, if we use the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as a crude proxy.The Western world sees itself as a paragon of civilisational progress and modernity, whereas the rest, namely, the East and the Global South, are much more diverse in culture, ethnicity and civilisational identity.Last year, the Ukraine war sharply divided world opinion. The Nato-led Western world united behind Ukraine. The  March 2022 UN resolution demanding that Russia immediately end its invasion of Ukraine was supported by 141 countries.

The images are heart-rending. Many Arab leaders have condemned the bombings in Gaza and focused on the humanitarian crisis.However, most Arab leaders have refrained from calling out Hamas for the initial, unwarranted attack on Israeli civilians. What was the need for a guerilla attack on civilians  in a kibbutz? Humaneness should run both ways, irrespective of nationality or religion.Arab leaders need a rethink. They should discourage militant organisations like  Hamas and  Hezbollah. They need to denounce violence in an unequivocal manner. They must admit the initial attack by Hamas on October 7 was a blunder and unwarranted.

When  Hamas militia  rampaged into Israel, abducting and murdering innocent men, women and children, including babies and the elderly, much of the vicious horror that ensued was live-streamed on social media.This was a harsh reminder of this historic conflict’s capacity for brutality and its immeasurable impact on ordinary, vulnerable and innocent families. People from at least 35 countries are reportedly dead, missing or among the  hostages.There has rightly been an outpouring of sympathy for Israel from Western government leaders whose support for the country is deeply embedded. Unfortunately, there seems to be less of an appetite to pursue a peaceful solution or intervene to stop the tragedy, which is  escalating by the hour and devastating the lives of millions of helpless, innocent Palestinian men, women and children.There is an enormous and growing concern regarding the  siege of Gaza, where communities are trapped in one of the world’s most densely populated areas, devoid of safe shelter amid  relentless military strikes. These people are being denied access to food, clean water and power. What little  humanitarian aid trickling in is entirely inadequate.

As Israeli forces have conducted air strikes and land operations in retaliation for Hamas’ attack in early October, Beijing has repeatedly  accused Israel of going “beyond self-defence” in its retaliation, and  vetoed a US-led resolution in the United Nations that reaffirmed the “inherent right of all states”.But it was not always the case.Before the US-China rivalry significantly reshaped the superpowers’ relationship with each other and their allies, China and Israel enjoyed cosy ties and military links so close that Washington found it necessary to intervene.That relationship has faded in recent decades – Israel’s dependence on the United States and the structural contradictions in China-US relations gradually chipped away at the close strategic ties between China and Israel.

We all want to know what risks are coming so we can prepare against the bad stuff and look forward to the good. Forecasting is difficult, and prediction is impossible. Forecasting tools range from fortune-tellers to highly sophisticated, casino-busting analytical models. All forecasters have a probability of getting it wrong, and the best can only find indicators of the future by looking to understand the past. The idea is that history repeats itself.In reality, history often doesn’t repeat itself but more commonly rhymes. We often see déjà vu happening all over again and take that as a guide that we will see a similar outcome as before, hoping that this time it is not too different.History is an uncertain guide because the exact circumstances are unrepeatable. Dominant narratives flow and bifurcate like a river; they can be strong and dominant upstream but turn out to be fake, off-target or misleading as time goes on.

The atrocities were some of the worst committed since Israel’s founding. Since then, the blaze of conflict has threatened to expand and the Middle East has come closer to the brink of regional war.Iranian proxies in Iraq and Lebanon are attacking American and Israeli assets, and the United States is taking a  more active role in the region than it has in well over a decade. This has included placing the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the  USS Gerald R. Ford, and a carrier strike group on standby in the East Mediterranean.

The common goal is to improve the region’s economic prosperity. But, while trade promotes peace, trade relationships cannot be sustained without peace.Some Apec members are either involved in conflicts with each other or have different opinions over the  Russia-Ukraine war, the  Israel-Hamas war, the  South China Sea territorial disputes, or the escalating US-China tensions. These political issues can make it challenging for Apec leaders to focus their discussions on regional trade and environmental sustainability issues.

But Palestinians have been oppressed and killed over the past 75 years and few have spoken up for them. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have said what Israel has done to Palestinians during this time is apartheid.Even former US president Barack Obama says in his book A Promised Land that most countries considered Israel’s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories to be a violation of international law and that Palestinians “lacked self-determination and many of the basic rights that even citizens of non-democratic countries enjoyed”.He also points out that US politicians receive significant donations from the Jewish bipartisan lobbying organisation American Israel Public Affairs Committee. This explains why the US continues to support Israel.

The military has been vague, even if its objectives are clear|Associated Press|2023-11-01T02:24:07.000Z|In recent days, Israeli ground troops have pushed deeper and deeper into Gaza in their war against Hamas, launched in response to a bloody October 7 cross-border raid by the Islamic militant group.A growing array of units, including naval, air and ground forces, have joined the effort. The army says it has killed scores of militants and damaged Hamas’ strategic tunnel network. Soldiers have taken over abandoned Palestinian homes to stake out positions.Yet even as the operation expands each day, the army refuses to call it an invasion.Its vague choice of words is more than an issue of semantics. It appears to be a deliberate strategy aimed at keeping its enemy off balance and preserving its options as a lengthy war unfolds.

The answer is: no one knows when the former will end, while no one knows when the latter will begin again even if it ends. Can China help win peace in the Middle East? The question is asked because of the obvious limitations of the other major powers at the moment.Russia has considerable influence in the Middle East, but given that it is fighting a war of its own, with Iran believed to be  one of its arms suppliers, it has little hope of winning Israel’s trust. The EU is deeply polarised and powerless in the face of  pro-Palestine Muslim protests across the continent and beyond. The US, being  Israel’s staunch ally, has historically provided unconditional support to Israel in all conflicts.That leaves China. After brokering a  historic rapprochement between once-estranged Saudi Arabia and Iran, a more ambitious Beijing had been trying to  initiate peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians even before the latest conflict erupted.

At issue was a contested White House request for US$106 billion in supplemental funding to aid Ukraine and Israel in their military and humanitarian struggles, contain China and strengthen US border security.“What happens in Ukraine, what happens in the Middle East, also matters for the Indo-Pacific. Beyond Europe, we know that our allies, as well as our adversaries, as well as our competitors, are watching that conflict. They’re watching our response,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, underscoring the importance of regional freedom of navigation. “So the funding request … is vital to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of mounting challenges in that region.”In the background of Tuesday’s hearing was the recent ascension of US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, who wants to provide stopgap financing only for Israel while shelving the other White House foreign policy funding priorities. He is also demanding cuts elsewhere in return for supporting one of America’s closest allies.

Hamas’  surprise assault on Israel is certainly an act of terror. Many countries have condemned Hamas and expressed support for Israel.While we should all combat terrorism, we cannot forget this ongoing tragedy is the result of both sides’ radicalisation. Israel has done as much to make this horror happen as Hamas.The increasing polarisation of Israeli politics forced Prime Minister Netanyahu to form a coalition with ultra-Orthodox parties. This led to a draconian government. For example, the national security minister directed the police to remove Palestinian flags from public places; the government also seized tax revenues belonging to the Palestinian Authority. A recently passed  law prevents the supreme court from overruling the government.

That’s because “China assists Iran” and “Iran provides substantial funding to Hamas”, according to the author.

Even though Israel has invested heavily in tunnel detection - including a sensor-equipped underground barrier it called an “iron wall” - Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels to the outside world."

Mobile phone service is spotty. Internet and power are out. Air strikes have pulverised roads and levelled neighbourhoods, slowing rescue work.Doctors scribble on notepads in overflowing morgues and hospital halls, struggling to account for bodies trapped under rubble and tossed in hastily dug mass graves. The chaos has added to the likelihood of errors.Yet the Gaza-based Ministry of Health – an agency in the Hamas-controlled government – continues to tally casualty numbers.

For a commercial powerhouse such as China, the advantages of cooperation with Washington for stability in the Middle East far outweigh those of trying to capitalise on a scenario in which the US remains stuck in two wars.The idea that the current course of geopolitical events is a strategic windfall for China in its competition with the US has proved popular in several quarters. Some say the conflict between Israel and Hamas, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,  will distract Washington from the Indo-Pacific, to China’s benefit.Washington’s support for Israel, as opposed to Beijing’s “neutral” position on the conflict, would also gain the Chinese more influence in the Middle East – and the whole Global South – including a potential  mediation role in the Israel-Palestine dispute.That all seems dubious. China’s rise over the past four decades has also been built on the absence of major military confrontations. In contrast, the war in Ukraine and the chaos in the Middle East are having global reverberations at a time when the world economy is struggling to regain momentum.

It also reaffirmed the “inherent right of all states” to self-defence while fully complying with international law.However, the proposal elicited harsh criticism from Beijing because it failed to call for a  ceasefire and made no mention of the Israeli military’s  evacuation order calling for over 1 million people to leave northern Gaza.“The draft does not reflect the world’s strongest calls for a ceasefire and an end to the fighting, and it does not help resolve the issue,” China’s ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Jun told the council after the vote on Wednesday.

As oil prices rise and the US budget deficit widens, bond yields will surge. This is likely to pop the stock and property bubbles in the US, then everywhere else.China’s surging trade surplus and wage inflation will only add pressure to its unofficial dollar peg. Once that “peg” breaks, the dollar will collapse.There is little doubt the US is experiencing a super bubble. Its asset prices are wildly overvalued, its debt on an  unsustainable path – and political paralysis makes any meaningful policy adjustment unlikely. Its structural fiscal deficit already stands at nearly US$2 trillion.As China’s commitment to keeping the yuan within a narrow trading band relative to the dollar – its “peg” – forms a protective shield against currency market fears of a dollar collapse, the bond market is  bearing all the pressure. But the growing conflict in the Middle East could tip the balance.

Cooperating on climate change will take many thousands of steps. California Governor Gavin Newsom has taken a significant and brave step to help push climate cooperation with his trip to Hong Kong.The goal was to promote a landmark annual forum for policy and research exchange on climate-related issues between the technology-driven bay areas of San Francisco and southern China. That it is being committed against the backdrop of rising tensions between the two world powers is another reason for people of goodwill to support the initiative.It was clear that Newsom’s trip would focus only on climate and sidestep other sensitive political or economic issues. It was obviously preapproved by both governments.Xi Jinping to meet California’s Newsom in latest sign Biden talks to followWell, sure enough, Newsom drew fire not only from Republican politicians but his own Democrats as well.

But the US has called for pauses to allow aid to enter Gaza, while Russia wants a humanitarian ceasefire.A pause is generally considered less formal and shorter than a ceasefire.

The recent escalation, triggered by Hamas’  Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and Israel’s response, also has significant geopolitical and economic ramifications for the rest of the world.For many decades, the US has been the primary power broker in the Middle East but, recently, China has been assuming a role of mediator. In March, Beijing facilitated the reconciliation of relations between historic Gulf adversaries  Iran and Saudi Arabia, a development some see as indicative of a shifting global order.Meanwhile, US efforts to coax a diplomatic normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Israel have been  disrupted by the latest outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas.Regionally, the violence threatens to  spread and could potentially involve Iranian proxies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon – Tehran has  made no secret of its support for Hamas. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which has clashed with Israel, has formidable military capabilities. Adding to the risk is the strategic significance of the Golan Heights, a water-rich, fertile area that Israel annexed from Syria, where Iranian-backed groups are known to be active.

While the United States, Europe and the Western media pushed the Ukraine war off the front pages to focus on the  atrocities occurring in Israel and the Gaza Strip, dozens of leaders from the Global South gathered at the  Belt and Road Forum in Beijing to join President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin to focus on trade, investment, economic development and infrastructure.In the West, the short-termism and overriding obsession with national security was palpable, with all calculations focused on hard-stretched military budgets and supplies. In Beijing, the focus was on long-term economic development, reducing poverty and multilateral cooperation. It reflected a  sharp global decoupling, but not as many in the West have conceived it. Both were “de-risking”, but they reflected sharply differing conceptions of risk and how to deal with it.For some in the West, Xi’s celebration of  the 10th anniversary of the belt and road strategy and the densely detailed outline of infrastructure-building priorities for the decade ahead was not newsworthy. For the cynical among them, it was dismissed as a not-so-subtle, self-serving assertion of Chinese soft power. For the conspiracy theorists, it was noteworthy only as evidence of Sino-Russian plotting to reshape the global rules-based order.Those who regard the Belt and Road Initiative as important and, on balance, of immense value are seen as naive and gullible. Be that as it may, here are the key points I took away from a busy and significant week in Beijing.A 10-year audit: Uncomfortable as it might be to some, the initiative is reshaping the balance of global economic power. The steadily rising importance of the Global South is becoming clear, as is China’s role in shaping it and “sister” institutions such as the soon-to-be  expanded Brics economies.

This is not surprising when you consider the extensive links between our city and that part of the world.For one thing, Hong Kong has a small but long-established  Jewish community of about 5,000 people which is naturally supportive of Israel. Many of us have friends among its members. The Israeli chamber of commerce is a substantial one, and we are an obvious location for business dealings between its enterprises and mainland ones, which sometimes go more smoothly on neutral ground.Twenty years ago, as head of InvestHK, I visited Israel many times to target tech and trading companies in particular. There is also a fine  Jewish secondary school in Shau Kei Wan which is open to students of all faiths. Full disclosure: my youngest son attended there after the local school system did not detect his dyslexia, was steered successfully to his International Baccalaureate and is now in his final year at university.We also have a substantial Muslim community of  some 300,000 people, originally a mixture of Pakistani and Chinese origin but buttressed in recent years by a large number of Indonesian domestic workers. They tend to be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.

And any such possibility would need buy-in from Arab nations around the region, which is by no means certain.Israeli officials have said repeatedly that they do not intend to occupy Gaza, but they’ve also said that continued rule by Hamas is unacceptable after the October 7 attack in which the group killed 1,400 Israelis and took 200 people hostage.The challenge of achieving both of those objectives has helped fuel US worries that Israel has not given sufficient thought to what comes after a ground assault. The US is also worried that a Gaza attack with no clear objective beyond ousting Hamas could fan the conflict into a regional war.

Publicly, administration officials sought to play down talk of a breakthrough as the talks advanced, but Biden was keen on the initiative and in July sent National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan to the kingdom.Israel has signed diplomatic deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan since 2020, but normalisation with Saudi Arabia, the biggest economy in the Middle East, would be a coup for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his country.

Hundreds of articles have been written by commentators from both sides of the ideological divide.What we know, however, is that it did not start on October 7, 2023; that there can be no winners; that it will not end if Gaza is razed to the ground; and that it has the potential to make the world an even more dangerous place.It puts into perspective all that loose talk in the last year by irresponsible politicians in the West about a war in  Taiwan. A region and an issue they have little understanding of, and about which they should not be inciting war. Perhaps the tragic events in the  Middle East will remind them – in case the  Ukraine war did not provide enough evidence – that there are only losers in all wars, and winning is in fact a loser’s game.

A day later, Israel declared war on Hamas, launching lethal air strikes and blocking aid amid an international outcry.

Israel on Thursday revised the known number of Israeli and foreign hostages to 203, including Britons.

Israeli officials have said that they don’t have a clear idea for what a post-war future might look like, though."

Many Americans understand,” Biden said as he wrapped up his stay in Tel Aviv, likening the October 7 Hamas assault to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people. “You can’t look at what has happened here … and not scream out for justice,” he said.“But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it,” he said. “After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.”Biden urged Israel to step back from the brink, not just to ease growing tensions in the Mideast that threaten to spiral into a broader regional conflict, but also to reassure a world rattled by images of carnage and suffering, in Israel and Gaza alike. One million people have been displaced in roughly 10 days, according to the United Nations.Volunteers from humanitarian aid organisations hold up Palestinian and Egyptian flags during a protest outside the Rafah border gate in Egypt on Wednesday.

Eight days before the attack, Sullivan had listed the positive developments in the Middle East that were allowing America to focus on other regions, declaring: “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.”Hamas’ onslaughts shattered the rosy picture. Paradoxically, it was  largely Washington’s doing that the “quieter” Middle East suddenly turned into a hellish war zone. America’s latest initiative to broker the normalisation of relations between  Israel and Saudi Arabia spurred Hamas into desperate action for fear that Palestinians’ interests would again be sacrificed, perhaps forever.Back in September 2020, the Trump administration brokered the  Abraham Accords, with the United Arab Emirates – together with Bahrain and Morocco – normalising its relations with Israel. The deal was preceded by Egypt and Jordan’s recognition of Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively.

Biden had been scheduled to visit Jordan after the stop in Israel, but meetings there with Arab leaders were called off after the hospital explosion.

The massacres, rapes and abductions of civilians from villages,  kibbutzim and a  music festival were a pogrom, confirming Hamas’ goal to destroy the state of Israel and all Israelis. That said, the situation demands historical context – not as any kind of justification, but for the sake of clarity about the way forward.A first consideration is the despair that characterises the lives of most Palestinians. Recall the spate of suicidal attacks on the streets of Jerusalem around a decade ago. An ordinary Palestinian would approach a Jew, pull out a knife, and stab the victim, knowing full well he or she would be immediately killed. There was no message in these “terrorist” acts, no shouts of “Free Palestine!” Nor was there any larger organisation behind them. They were individual acts of violent despair.Things took a turn for the worse when Benjamin Netanyahu formed a  new government by allying with far-right, pro-settler parties that advocate annexation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank.The new minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, believes: “My right, my wife’s right, my kids’ right to move around freely [in the West Bank] is more important than that of the Arabs.” This is a man previously barred from army service, owing to his affiliations with extremist anti-Arab parties designated as terrorist organisations following the  1994 massacre of Arabs in Hebron.

Despite Israel indiscriminately  bombing targets across Gaza, Western nations like the US and UK have largely supported Israel, barring a few calls for restraint.It is interesting to note that China has not taken a similar stance to the US and in fact gone on to  condemn Israel’s aggression, noting that its response to Hamas’ attack was disproportionate. It is thus useful to examine China’s motivations on this issue and how it has capitalised on the opportunity to expand its own  role in the Middle East.China’s engagement in the Israel-Palestine conflict has evolved throughout the last few decades. Initially, it was quite supportive of the Palestinian cause, even arming factions of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in the 1960s. Towards the late 1970s, after the death of Mao Zedong, it changed its position on the issue, opting to take a less ideological stance.As such, it  expanded relations with Israel, including by buying weapons. Both nations also armed factions of the Afghan mujahideen in the 1980s against the Soviet Union. This was mainly to prevent a Soviet presence in Afghanistan, which China considers its backyard.

Neither account could be independently corroborated.Hours later on Wednesday, an Israel military spokesman said there was  no structural damage to buildings around the hospital and no craters consistent with an air strike.

Bisharat has long argued that a state cannot claim self-defence vis-à-vis a territory it already occupies. The American professor of law wrote: “The Charter of the United Nations explicitly preserves the right of states to act in self-defence. It is, however, a limited exception to the general obligation established in the Charter that states resolve their disputes by pacific means. Under Article 51, a state making a claim of self-defence must have been the target of an ‘armed attack’ by another state.”

But in at least one case, the hidden passageways were used to abet the cross-border attacks which last week killed 1,200 people, supplementing incursions by air, land and sea.Now, as Israel signals an imminent ground invasion of Gaza, the same network is complicating its military retaliation – not least because Hamas says it is holding Israeli hostages in subterranean rooms.


“Think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for Hamas,” said Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces. “We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built.”"

But his administration is worried that the Israeli government isn’t ready for the fallout from the massive invasion that could come at any hour.People familiar with the Biden administration’s stance say the White House fears that Israel does not have a plan for what comes next for Gaza after an invasion, and is pressing them to think beyond the immediate goal of eradicating Hamas. They asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.The people said Biden’s team has also voiced anxiety about Israel’s demand that residents evacuate northern Gaza in 24 hours, a deadline that both the EU and UN say is unrealistic. Soon after Israel made the demand, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby acknowledged an evacuation in Gaza would be “a tall order.”The desire to support Israel versus the fear about what might come next underscores the delicate balancing act Biden faces. A punishing campaign in Gaza and no clear endpoint risks fanning Israel’s worst crisis in 50 years in to a regional conflagration the US and its allies would struggle to contain.Hamas rehearsed for Israel attack in plain sight, posted video of mock assaultFor the time being, Biden and his team have sought to show unflinching support given the scale of the horror from last weekend’s attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200 Israelis and saw dozens taken hostage.

It applies to a wide variety of circumstances. In financial markets, it serves as a reminder of the acute challenges in making predictions about the performance of the global economy and asset prices in a time of increasing uncertainty.Up until the 2008 financial crisis, international investors never took seriously non-economic risks – those that are harder to quantify, such as  political risk, wars and revolutions. This was because such threats were perceived to be a problem faced by unstable emerging markets.Yet, following the outbreak of the  euro-zone crisis in 2011-12, which showed how difficult it is to maintain a monetary union consisting of sovereign states with diverging economic policies, markets began to pay more attention to political risk.The unexpected decision by Britain in June 2016 to vote to  leave the European Union, followed by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election five months later, showed that even the supposedly safest advanced economies can face political shocks.
