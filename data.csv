He also echoed President Joe Biden’s calls for a brief halt in the fighting to address a worsening humanitarian crisis.Alarm has grown over spiralling Palestinian deaths and deepening misery for civilians from weeks of Israeli bombardment and a widening ground assault that risks even greater casualties. Overwhelmed hospitals say they are nearing collapse, with medicine and fuel running low under the Israeli siege. About 1.5 million people in Gaza, or 70 per cent of the population, have fled their homes, the UN said on Friday.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (left) met Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel pressed ahead with its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Israel responded by relentlessly bombarding the enclave, then invading it.Areepen Uttarasin, a veteran Thai politician and former education minister, said he travelled to the Iranian capital Tehran and met senior Hamas officials there on October 26 for more than two hours.“They told me that the Thai hostages are living comfortably and are out of danger,” Areepen said, declining to name the Hamas officials he met. “I told them that I am here not to negotiate but simply to ask for their release.”Areepen Uttarasin, a veteran Thailand politician and former education minister.

It feels like a balance has been lost between the West and rest.What is the West? It is a world that essentially comprises the US-led North America, Europe and Australasia, including Japan. It accounts for 63 per cent of the world economy, three-quarters of world trade, over half of global energy consumption and 18 per cent of the world population, if we use the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as a crude proxy.The Western world sees itself as a paragon of civilisational progress and modernity, whereas the rest, namely, the East and the Global South, are much more diverse in culture, ethnicity and civilisational identity.Last year, the Ukraine war sharply divided world opinion. The Nato-led Western world united behind Ukraine. The  March 2022 UN resolution demanding that Russia immediately end its invasion of Ukraine was supported by 141 countries.

The images are heart-rending. Many Arab leaders have condemned the bombings in Gaza and focused on the humanitarian crisis.However, most Arab leaders have refrained from calling out Hamas for the initial, unwarranted attack on Israeli civilians. What was the need for a guerilla attack on civilians  in a kibbutz? Humaneness should run both ways, irrespective of nationality or religion.Arab leaders need a rethink. They should discourage militant organisations like  Hamas and  Hezbollah. They need to denounce violence in an unequivocal manner. They must admit the initial attack by Hamas on October 7 was a blunder and unwarranted.

When  Hamas militia  rampaged into Israel, abducting and murdering innocent men, women and children, including babies and the elderly, much of the vicious horror that ensued was live-streamed on social media.This was a harsh reminder of this historic conflict’s capacity for brutality and its immeasurable impact on ordinary, vulnerable and innocent families. People from at least 35 countries are reportedly dead, missing or among the  hostages.There has rightly been an outpouring of sympathy for Israel from Western government leaders whose support for the country is deeply embedded. Unfortunately, there seems to be less of an appetite to pursue a peaceful solution or intervene to stop the tragedy, which is  escalating by the hour and devastating the lives of millions of helpless, innocent Palestinian men, women and children.There is an enormous and growing concern regarding the  siege of Gaza, where communities are trapped in one of the world’s most densely populated areas, devoid of safe shelter amid  relentless military strikes. These people are being denied access to food, clean water and power. What little  humanitarian aid trickling in is entirely inadequate.

As Israeli forces have conducted air strikes and land operations in retaliation for Hamas’ attack in early October, Beijing has repeatedly  accused Israel of going “beyond self-defence” in its retaliation, and  vetoed a US-led resolution in the United Nations that reaffirmed the “inherent right of all states”.But it was not always the case.Before the US-China rivalry significantly reshaped the superpowers’ relationship with each other and their allies, China and Israel enjoyed cosy ties and military links so close that Washington found it necessary to intervene.That relationship has faded in recent decades – Israel’s dependence on the United States and the structural contradictions in China-US relations gradually chipped away at the close strategic ties between China and Israel.

We all want to know what risks are coming so we can prepare against the bad stuff and look forward to the good. Forecasting is difficult, and prediction is impossible. Forecasting tools range from fortune-tellers to highly sophisticated, casino-busting analytical models. All forecasters have a probability of getting it wrong, and the best can only find indicators of the future by looking to understand the past. The idea is that history repeats itself.In reality, history often doesn’t repeat itself but more commonly rhymes. We often see déjà vu happening all over again and take that as a guide that we will see a similar outcome as before, hoping that this time it is not too different.History is an uncertain guide because the exact circumstances are unrepeatable. Dominant narratives flow and bifurcate like a river; they can be strong and dominant upstream but turn out to be fake, off-target or misleading as time goes on.

Hamas, which governs the densely populated Gaza Strip and is listed as a terrorist organisation by Washington, attacked  Israel on October 7, killing some 1,400 people, according to Israel. And at least 8,800 Gaza residents have been killed in Israeli counterstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry."

For the world, the stakes have not been higher since the 1973  Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, when Russian and American intervention took it to the brink of atomic war.The current war began on  October 7 with a surprise attack by Hamas terrorists on Israeli communities bordering Gaza. The atrocities were some of the worst committed since Israel’s founding. Since then, the blaze of conflict has threatened to expand and the Middle East has come closer to the brink of regional war.Iranian proxies in Iraq and Lebanon are attacking American and Israeli assets, and the United States is taking a  more active role in the region than it has in well over a decade. This has included placing the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the  USS Gerald R. Ford, and a carrier strike group on standby in the East Mediterranean.

The common goal is to improve the region’s economic prosperity. But, while trade promotes peace, trade relationships cannot be sustained without peace.Some Apec members are either involved in conflicts with each other or have different opinions over the  Russia-Ukraine war, the  Israel-Hamas war, the  South China Sea territorial disputes, or the escalating US-China tensions. These political issues can make it challenging for Apec leaders to focus their discussions on regional trade and environmental sustainability issues.

But Palestinians have been oppressed and killed over the past 75 years and few have spoken up for them. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have said what Israel has done to Palestinians during this time is apartheid.Even former US president Barack Obama says in his book A Promised Land that most countries considered Israel’s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories to be a violation of international law and that Palestinians “lacked self-determination and many of the basic rights that even citizens of non-democratic countries enjoyed”.He also points out that US politicians receive significant donations from the Jewish bipartisan lobbying organisation American Israel Public Affairs Committee. This explains why the US continues to support Israel.

The military has been vague, even if its objectives are clear|Associated Press|2023-11-01T02:24:07.000Z|In recent days, Israeli ground troops have pushed deeper and deeper into Gaza in their war against Hamas, launched in response to a bloody October 7 cross-border raid by the Islamic militant group.A growing array of units, including naval, air and ground forces, have joined the effort. The army says it has killed scores of militants and damaged Hamas’ strategic tunnel network. Soldiers have taken over abandoned Palestinian homes to stake out positions.Yet even as the operation expands each day, the army refuses to call it an invasion.Its vague choice of words is more than an issue of semantics. It appears to be a deliberate strategy aimed at keeping its enemy off balance and preserving its options as a lengthy war unfolds.

The answer is: no one knows when the former will end, while no one knows when the latter will begin again even if it ends. Can China help win peace in the Middle East? The question is asked because of the obvious limitations of the other major powers at the moment.Russia has considerable influence in the Middle East, but given that it is fighting a war of its own, with Iran believed to be  one of its arms suppliers, it has little hope of winning Israel’s trust. The EU is deeply polarised and powerless in the face of  pro-Palestine Muslim protests across the continent and beyond. The US, being  Israel’s staunch ally, has historically provided unconditional support to Israel in all conflicts.That leaves China. After brokering a  historic rapprochement between once-estranged Saudi Arabia and Iran, a more ambitious Beijing had been trying to  initiate peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians even before the latest conflict erupted.

At issue was a contested White House request for US$106 billion in supplemental funding to aid Ukraine and Israel in their military and humanitarian struggles, contain China and strengthen US border security.“What happens in Ukraine, what happens in the Middle East, also matters for the Indo-Pacific. Beyond Europe, we know that our allies, as well as our adversaries, as well as our competitors, are watching that conflict. They’re watching our response,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, underscoring the importance of regional freedom of navigation. “So the funding request … is vital to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of mounting challenges in that region.”In the background of Tuesday’s hearing was the recent ascension of US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, who wants to provide stopgap financing only for Israel while shelving the other White House foreign policy funding priorities.

Hamas’  surprise assault on Israel is certainly an act of terror. Many countries have condemned Hamas and expressed support for Israel.While we should all combat terrorism, we cannot forget this ongoing tragedy is the result of both sides’ radicalisation. Israel has done as much to make this horror happen as Hamas.The increasing polarisation of Israeli politics forced Prime Minister Netanyahu to form a coalition with ultra-Orthodox parties. This led to a draconian government. For example, the national security minister directed the police to remove Palestinian flags from public places; the government also seized tax revenues belonging to the Palestinian Authority. A recently passed  law prevents the supreme court from overruling the government.

One of my favourites is that Beijing was behind Hamas’ terrorist attacks. Seriously! And it’s not some wild theory floating exclusively online and being promoted by unhinged influencers. It’s in mass circulation newspapers.Taipei Times, the English-language sister publication of Liberty Times, recently ran an op-ed titled, “China’s connection to Israel attacks”.How? That’s because “China assists Iran” and “Iran provides substantial funding to Hamas”, according to the author.

Even though Israel has invested heavily in tunnel detection - including a sensor-equipped underground barrier it called an “iron wall” - Hamas is still thought to have working tunnels to the outside world."

For a commercial powerhouse such as China, the advantages of cooperation with Washington for stability in the Middle East far outweigh those of trying to capitalise on a scenario in which the US remains stuck in two wars.The idea that the current course of geopolitical events is a strategic windfall for China in its competition with the US has proved popular in several quarters. Some say the conflict between Israel and Hamas, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,  will distract Washington from the Indo-Pacific, to China’s benefit.Washington’s support for Israel, as opposed to Beijing’s “neutral” position on the conflict, would also gain the Chinese more influence in the Middle East – and the whole Global South – including a potential  mediation role in the Israel-Palestine dispute.That all seems dubious. China’s rise over the past four decades has also been built on the absence of major military confrontations. In contrast, the war in Ukraine and the chaos in the Middle East are having global reverberations at a time when the world economy is struggling to regain momentum.

It also reaffirmed the “inherent right of all states” to self-defence while fully complying with international law.However, the proposal elicited harsh criticism from Beijing because it failed to call for a  ceasefire and made no mention of the Israeli military’s  evacuation order calling for over 1 million people to leave northern Gaza.“The draft does not reflect the world’s strongest calls for a ceasefire and an end to the fighting, and it does not help resolve the issue,” China’s ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Jun told the council after the vote on Wednesday.

As oil prices rise and the US budget deficit widens, bond yields will surge. This is likely to pop the stock and property bubbles in the US, then everywhere else.China’s surging trade surplus and wage inflation will only add pressure to its unofficial dollar peg. Once that “peg” breaks, the dollar will collapse.There is little doubt the US is experiencing a super bubble. Its asset prices are wildly overvalued, its debt on an  unsustainable path – and political paralysis makes any meaningful policy adjustment unlikely. Its structural fiscal deficit already stands at nearly US$2 trillion.As China’s commitment to keeping the yuan within a narrow trading band relative to the dollar – its “peg” – forms a protective shield against currency market fears of a dollar collapse, the bond market is  bearing all the pressure. But the growing conflict in the Middle East could tip the balance.

The recent escalation, triggered by Hamas’  Operation Al-Aqsa Flood and Israel’s response, also has significant geopolitical and economic ramifications for the rest of the world.For many decades, the US has been the primary power broker in the Middle East but, recently, China has been assuming a role of mediator. In March, Beijing facilitated the reconciliation of relations between historic Gulf adversaries  Iran and Saudi Arabia, a development some see as indicative of a shifting global order.Meanwhile, US efforts to coax a diplomatic normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Israel have been  disrupted by the latest outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas.Regionally, the violence threatens to  spread and could potentially involve Iranian proxies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon – Tehran has  made no secret of its support for Hamas. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which has clashed with Israel, has formidable military capabilities. Adding to the risk is the strategic significance of the Golan Heights, a water-rich, fertile area that Israel annexed from Syria, where Iranian-backed groups are known to be active.
